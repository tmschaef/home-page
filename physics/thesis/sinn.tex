{\em And now reader, bestir thyself - for though we will always
lend thee proper assistance in difficult places, as we do not,
like some others, expect thee to use the arts of divination to
discover our meaning, yet we shall not indulge thy laziness
where nothing but thy own attention is required; for thou art
highly mistaken if thou dost imagine that we intended when we
begin this great to leave thy sagacity nothing to do. \\
