<UL>
  <LI>Plan for 30 minutes of presentation with 5-10 minutes additional for

  topic with the approval of the instructors. Generally, the topic will be
  fairly broad.
  <LI>Try to convey an idea of what the topic is about, at the level of your
  fellow students.
  <LI>Prepare a written abstract with references (See the APS format <A

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#008000"><P>Topics in Nuclear Physics</P>
</EM><B><P>Jet Quenching:</B> Particle jets arise from quarks or gluons 
scattered with large momentum transfer. In heavy ion collisions
the scattered quarks and gluons traverse matter and should lose a
large amount of energy if the density is high. Jet quenching was recently 
observed in PHENIX. Discuss the result, focussing on either 
theoretical or experimental aspects.<BR>
<EM>Jacak, Drees </P>
</FONT>
<B><P>J/Psi suppression, a signature for deconfinement of quarks:</B> 
In collisions of heavy ions fewer J/psi mesons are produced than expected
from summing independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. This was predicted 
as a signature of quark-gluon plasma formation. Briefly describe the concept 
of quark gluon plasma. Discuss the mechanism of suppression of the J/psi and 
recent data. <BR>
<EM>Drees, Jacak</P>
</EM><B><P>Electromagnetic Radiation from Hot, Dense Nuclear Matter:</B> 
Enhanced radiation of lepton pairs from the hot and dense 
reaction volume created in collision of nuclei was discovered at CERN. 
The data indicate melting of the QCD vacuum and therefore the presence 
of a QCD phase transition. Show the experimental results and 
interpretations.<BR>
<EM>Drees, Hemmick, Rapp, Zahed </P>
</EM><B><P>Equilibrated Hadron Gas in Nuclear Collisions:</B> The number
and spectra of particles produced in heavy ion collisions is well described
by statistical emission from an equilibrated gas of hadrons. Data 
indicate that hadrons decouple at a temperature near 170 MeV, near
the QCD phase transition between quarks and hadrons. Describe the
measurements, statistical analysis and interpretation. <BR>
<EM>Shuryak, Prakash, Jacak, Hemmick </P>
</EM><B><P>Particle Interferometry:</B> The space-time extent of the
collision region formed in nuclear reactions can be studied by measuring 
the interference between two identical outgoing particles. Measurements
at RHIC show a surprise: the sizes are no larger than at lower energy,
even though RHIC produces more particles and more explosive collisions.
Explain the technique and discuss the recent results. <BR>
<EM>Jacak, Hemmick, Brown, Shuryak </P>
</EM><B><P>Elliptic Flow of Matter </B> The high particle multiplicity in heavy
ion collisions produces high pressure and non-isotropic particle emission
patterns. The anisotropy at RHIC is large and indicates rapid equilibration
followed by hydrodynamic expansion. Discuss the phenomenon and to what
extent it indicates quark gluon plasma formation.<BR>
<EM>Shuryak, Hemmick</P>
</EM><B><P>Where are the quarks inside nuclei?</B> Discuss scattering of leptons from nuclei and dilepton production via the Drell-Yan process to probe quark and antiquark distributions. What do we learn from such data about the quark structure functions, and what is the effect of the nuclear medium? <BR>
<EM>Jacak, Marx</P>
</EM><B><P>Measurements of the Electron Neutrino Mass:</B> Discuss the various experiments to measure electron neutrino masses from beta-decay endpoint measurements and double-beta decay. Give the latest results What are the neutrino masses in the Standard Model. <BR>
<EM>Schrock</P>
</EM><B><P>Parity Non-conservation in Atoms:</B> The strength of parity violating transitions in atoms allow determination of standard-model parameters at low <I>q</I>-squared. Discuss the experiments and the model sensitivities.<BR>
<EM>Sprouse, Orozco</P>
</EM><B><P>Nuclear Sizes and Moments from Hyperfine Laser Spectroscopy:</B> Precise data on nuclear charge radii and electromagnetic moments can be obtained from hyperfine spectroscopy using lasers. Discuss how these experiments are done. Give examples of deduced nuclear properties such as the nuclear compressibility. Also discuss the use of laser spectroscopy to trap radioactive ions to study parity non-conservation in atomic transitions. <BR>
<EM>Sprouse</P>
</EM><B><P>Nuclear Structure at the Extremes of Neutron-Proton (Isospin) Imbalance:</B> Topics include - physics at the proton/neutron drip-lines, n-p pairing, neutron halo nuclei, radio active beam (RIB) facilities, octupole deformations in fission fragments.<BR>
<EM>Fossan</P>
</EM><B><P>Nuclear Structure at Extreme Angular Momentum:</B> Super-deformed (axis ratio 2:1) nuclear states have been identified at angular momenta up to 70. Discuss the theoretical basis why axis ratios of 2:1 and even 3:1 are stable. Explain recent experiments which use the large Ge arrays to measure super and hyper-deformed bands in a systematic fashion. <BR>
<EM>Fossan</P>
</EM><B><P>Giant Resonances as a Nuclear Clock:</B> Discuss how measurements of the strength of Giant Dipole Resonance in hot heavy large nuclei can be used to time large scale nuclear motion as exemplified by the fission process. Discuss how these measurements can be translated into a nuclear dissipation as a function of nuclear temperature and relate the results in terms of various fundamental models for dissipation in nuclear matter. <BR>
<EM>Jacak, Paul</P>
</EM><B><P>Super-Heavy Nuclei:</B> Well-founded nuclear model calculations have predicted a stable (lifetimes between 1 and 100 years) island of very heavy nuclei near Z--1 14 and A--300. A few such nuclei have recently been detected. Discuss the theoretical basis for the super-heavy island and the possible approaches to it by use of heavy ion reactions. Discuss the (somewhat controversial) results from recent experiments. <BR>
<EM>Sprouse, Jacak </P>
</EM><B><P>Nuclear Liquid-Gas Phase Transition:</B> Under the influence of heat and pressure nuclear matter is expected to undergo a liquid-gas phase transition. Report on recent experiment showing fragmentation of nuclei into large clusters (droplets) at intermediate energies (several 100 MeV/u) which are interpreted in terms of such a phase transition. Discuss the theoretical connection of these experiments with a phase transition from a nuclear liquid to a nuclear gas phase. <BR>
