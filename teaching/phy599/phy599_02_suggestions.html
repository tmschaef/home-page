Here are some suggestions on putting together
an effective oral presentation.<br><br>


<H2>I. Organization of a Talk</H2>
<ul>
<li><B>Talk Outline:</B><br>
    <ul>useful to let the audience know what's coming and 
	 let the speaker get warmed up.</ul>
</li>
<li><B>Introduction:</B><br>
    <ul>What's the issue?<br>
        Why is it interesting?</ul>
</li>
<li><B>Body of the Talk:</B>
    <ul><li>Experiment or method<br>
	   How does this issue get addressed?<br>
	   Describe the experiment or theoretical assumptions
	   How were the data analyzed/what theoretical techniques 
	    were used?<br>
	   What sources and magnitudes of uncertainty remain?<br></li>
    <li>Results<br>
	   What's the answer?<br></li>
    <li>Discussion<br>
	   What does it mean?<br>
	   Interpret the results to form a physical picutre and 
	    answer the question posed in the introduction.<br>
	   Connect experiment and theory.<br></li></ul>
<li><B>Conclusion:</B><br>
    <ul>What did we learn?<br>
        Summarize the main point(s) of the talk and reiterate 
        "the answer".</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<H2>II. A Few Hints:</H2>
<ul>
<li>A good talk has only a few main points:
     <ul><li>If reviewing a topic or field, ask:
	What is it about? Why is it interesting? What's the 
	 current hot question?</li>
     <li>If reporting on your own research:
	Why is it interesting? What did I do? What did I learn?</li>
     <li>It's better to choose fewer points and make sure your 
	 audience really gets them.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Don't go into too much detail!!
     <ul><li>Give only enough detail so the audience can understand 
	 the answer and form an opinion as to whether it's 
	 believable.</li>
     <li>When in doubt, prepare a reserve slide with all the details. 
	 Show it only if asked a question about these details, or if 
	 your audience looks very confused by your summary of how the 
	 work was done.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Talk to your audience:
     <ul><li>The speaker ALWAYS knows more about the subject than the 
	 average audience member! The purpose of the talk is to teach 
	 them about something they don't know and you do.</li>
     <li>Speak slowly and clearly and watch the faces of your audience 
	 to see if they are following you. LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE, not 
	 your slides.</li>
     <li>Don't read your slides word for word.</li>
     <li>Don't stand between the audience and your slides.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Slides:
     <ul><li>Must be legible even from the back of the room.</li>
     <li>No yellow pens! Orange is iffy.</li>
     <li>The slides should not be too busy. It is better to make 
	 more slides with less material on each. Also avoid writing 
	 whole sentences; the slides should be bullets or an outline 
	 for what you plan to say.</li>
     <li>Estimate an average of 1 - 2 speaking minutes per slide.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><B>Practice your talk!</B>
     <ul><li>This is extremely useful, no matter how  experienced you are.</li>
     <li>It helps you get your story together and check the clarity 
	 of your presentation. Also this lets you optimize the amount 
	 of material for the time you have.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Remember to ask yourself "So What?" This keeps your talk interesting 
   and focussed.
</li>
</ul>

<H2>III. Information sources for Nuclear and Particle Physics, and Astrophysics and
Cosmology</H2>
<ul>
<li>General interest science periodicals:<br>
    <ul>Scientific American<br>
        Dicover, Science News, etc.<br>
	Science, Nature</ul>
</li>
<li>Review Articles:<br>
    <ul>Annual Review of Nuclear Science<br>
	Physics Reports<br>
	Reviews of Modern Physics<br>
	Review Books<br>
	from the "private collections" of people
	 working in the field.</ul>
</li>
<li>Letter journals:<br>
    <ul>Phys. Rev. Letters<br>
	Physics Letters</ul>
</li>
<li>All the details:<br>
    <ul>Phys. Rev. C,D<br>
	Zeitschift fuer Physik<br>
	Nuclear Physics<br>
	Conference Proceedings</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<H2>IV. For this course:</H2>
<ul>
  <li>Aim for about <B>35 minutes</B> of speaking time.</li>
  <li>Remember to make and turn in your abstract in the week before
      your speaking day.</li>
  <li>Be sure to visit with one of the professors to go through 
      your material/plans or outline about a week before your talk.</li>
</ul>
