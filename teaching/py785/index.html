 Physics 785 (Advanced Electricity and Magnetism) is a graduate level
introduction to the classical theory of the electromagnetic field.
The first semester covers mainly static phenomena, and the second
semester (PY 786) will cover time dependent phenomena.

<LI> <B> Lecture:</B>
 MWF 9:10-10:00, RID 314<BR>
<LI> <B>Instructor:</B> T. Schaefer, Office RID 400F<BR>
 email: Thomas_Schaefer[at]ncsu.edu<BR>
 Office hours: MW. 3:00-4:00 and by appointment.<BR>
<LI> <B>Teaching Assistant:</B> TBA
 <LI><B>Homework:</B><BR> 
Most Fridays a set of homework problems will be 
assigned. (You can also check the website.) The homework is due Friday 
the following week at 10:00am. No late homework will be accepted.<BR>

 <LI><B>Exams</B><BR>
 There will be two midterm exams and a final.<BR>

 <LI><B>Grade</B><BR>
 Your final grade will be determined by weighting the various 
 portions of the course as follows:<BR>
 Midterms: 30%, Final: 40%, Homework: 30%<BR>

 <LI><B>Textbook</B><BR>
(required) Classical Electrodynamics (Third Edition),
John David Jackson. This is really the only book you need. If you 
absolutely think you need something else: ``Introduction to Electrodynamics''
by David J. Griffiths is an abridged version of Jackson for undergraduates, 
and ``Classical Electrodynamics'' by Walter Greiner is a translation of 
Jackson's book to German, which was subsequently translated back to 
english. An extra resource are two volumes in the series by Landau 
and Lifshitz,  ``The Classical Theory of Fields'' (Vol 2) and  
``Electrodynamics of Continuous Media'' (Vol 8).

 <LI><B>Course Objectives</B><BR>
 The objectives of the course are (i) to introduce the student to 
electrodynamics at a theoretically sophisticated level; (ii) develop 
problem solving skills; (iii) develop the techniques of mathematical 
physics to solve problems in E&M as well as other areas of physics.
 
 <LI><B>Academic Integrity Policies</B><BR>The University has a formal 
policy on Academic Integrity, included in the 
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php">Code of Student Conduct</a>. 
For PY785, the implications are straightforward: your work is your own unless 
collaboration is explicitly authorized (or required). With regard to to 
homework assignments I find it acceptable (indeed desirable) to collaborate 
with other students in solving the homework problems, but I expect you to 
write up the results on your own. Handing in copies of other student's work,
or of material that is available on the internet is not acceptable. 


 <LI><B>Students with Disabilities</B>
NC State University is committed to providing appropriate support and
accommodation to students with documented disabilities.  It is,
however, the student's responsibility to contact the Disability Services
Office (DSO; Student Health Center; 515-7653;
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/dso">
http://www.ncsu.edu/dso)</a>
who provide a
range of services and can coordinate contact with faculty to request
appropriate accommodations.  The student must present documentation
from DSO to a faculty member in whose class accommodations are
requested.  All this is normal and well-understood by faculty in
Physics, where reasonable accommodations are routinely arranged.

Note: A useful relation (which we did not discuss in class)
is Jackson (3.108). The proposed answer to 3.12c may not 
be right -- I get a slightly different result (also involving 
elliptic integrals).

<LI> HW8 (due Oct 29): Jackson 4.7, 4.9, 4.10.
[<a href="em_hw8_sol.pdf">solution</a>]<BR>
(There was a typo in the initial assignment -- it 
listed 4.12 rather than 4.10. You may hand in either 
one of these two problems.)

<LI> HW9 (due Nov 12): [<a href="hw9.pdf">problem</a>,<a href="em_hw9_sol.pdf">solution</a>]<BR>
Note: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann_equations">Cauchy-Riemann differential equations</a> express the conditions that a complex function f(z)=u(x,y)+i*v(x,y) with z=x+i*y has to satisfy in order to be analytic (differentiable in the complex plane). 

<LI> HW10 (due Nov 22): Jackson 5.3, 5.6, 5.13.
