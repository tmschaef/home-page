 Physics 785 (Advanced Electricity and Magnetism) is a graduate level
introduction to the classical theory of the electromagnetic field.
The first semester covers mainly static phenomena, and the second
semester (PY 786) will cover time dependent phenomena.

<LI> <B> Lecture:</B>
 MWF 9:10-10:00, RID 314<BR>
<LI> <B>Instructor:</B> T. Schaefer, Office RID 400F<BR>
 email: Thomas_Schaefer[at]ncsu.edu<BR>
 Office hours: MW. 3:00-4:00 and by appointment.<BR>
<LI> <B>Teaching Assistant:</B> TBA
 <LI><B>Homework:</B><BR> 
Most Fridays a set of homework problems will be 
assigned. (You can also check the website.) The homework is due Friday 
the following week at 9:10am. No late homework will be accepted. The
lowest homework score will be dropped. <BR>

 <LI><B>Exams</B><BR>
 There will be two midterm exams and a final.<BR>

 <LI><B>Grade</B><BR>
 Your final grade will be determined by weighting the various 
 portions of the course as follows:<BR>
 Midterms: 30%, Final: 40%, Homework: 30%<BR>

 <LI><B>Textbook</B><BR>
(required) Classical Electrodynamics (Third Edition),
John David Jackson. This is really the only book you need. If you 
absolutely think you need to consult another text book: ``Introduction 
to Electrodynamics'' by David J. Griffiths is an abridged version of 
Jackson for undergradutes, and ``Classical Electrodynamics'' by Walter 
Greiner is (basically) a translation of Jackson's book to German, which 
was subsequently translated back to english. An extra resource are 
two volumes in the series by Landau and Lifshitz,  ``The Classical 
Theory of Fields'' (Vol 2) and  ``Electrodynamics of Continuous Media'' 
(Vol 8).

 <LI><B>Course Objectives</B><BR>
 The objectives of the course are (i) to introduce the student to 
electrodynamics at a theoretically sophisticated level; (ii) develop 
problem solving skills; (iii) develop the techniques of mathematical 
physics to solve problems in E&M as well as other areas of physics.
 
 <LI><B>Academic Integrity Policies</B><BR>The University has a formal 
policy on Academic Integrity, included in the 
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/student_services/student_discipline/POL11.35.1.php">Code of Student Conduct</a>. 
For PY785, the implications are straightforward: your work is your own unless 
collaboration is explicitly authorized (or required). With regard to to 
homework assignments I find it acceptable (indeed desirable) to collaborate 
with other students in solving the homework problems, but I expect you to 
write up the results on your own. Handing in copies of other student's work,
or of material that is available on the internet is not acceptable. 


 <LI><B>Students with Disabilities</B>
NC State University is committed to providing appropriate support and
accommodation to students with documented disabilities.  It is,
however, the student's responsibility to contact the Disability Services
Office (DSO; Student Health Center; 515-7653;
<a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/dso">
http://www.ncsu.edu/dso)</a>
who provide a
range of services and can coordinate contact with faculty to request
appropriate accommodations.  The student must present documentation
from DSO to a faculty member in whose class accommodations are
requested.  All this is normal and well-understood by faculty in
Physics, where reasonable accommodations are routinely arranged.

The eaxm is closed book (no notes). You can bring the two index 
cards prepared for the two midterms, plus a third one. Material:
Jackson 1.1-5.12 (and 5.16). Here is a quick summary of things 
I expect you to know (<a href="em_basics.pdf">basics</a>). This
is last years <a href="py785_final_last_year.pdf">final</a>
and  <a href="em_final_sol.pdf">solutions</a>.

<LI> Qualifying Exam: Friday, January 6<BR>
The rules will be the same as in the PY785 final (you can bring 
your index cards, the <a href="em_basics.pdf">things you should 
know</a> still apply). This is the EM section of last years 
qualifying exam:
