\begin{enumerate}

\item{Consider the one-dimensional potential well
\[
V(x) =\left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
  \infty & x<0,\, x>a \\
   0     & 0<x<a
\end{array}\right.
\]
discussed in class. Compute the expectation values 
of $x,x^2,p,p^2$. Remember that $\hat{p}=-i\hbar d/dx$.}

\item{The energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional 
potential well are 
\[
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2\pi^2n^2}{2ma}, \hspace{1cm} (n>0).
\]
What is the ground state energy of a $0.1$ kg billiard 
plan which is confined between two walls 1m apart? What 
is the corresponding (classical) velocity? What is the 
quantum number $n$ corresponding to the billiard ball 
moving at $v=0.1$ m/s?}
