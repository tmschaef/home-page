<LI>  A skate boarder (60 kg) hits the bottom of a ramp going with velocity
      v. The ramp has the shape of a quarter-circle of radius R=3m. 
      a) How fast does the skate boarder have to go in order to     
      reach the top of the ramp? b) If she comes in with exactly this
      velocity, what is the normal force of the skate boarder on 
      the ramp when she reaches half the maximum height?
<LI>  A 2.0 kg block is pushed against a spring with negligible mass
      and spring constant k=400 N/m, compressing it 0.22 m. When the 
      block is released it moves along a horizontal surface and then 
      up an incline with slope 40 degrees (ignore friction). a) What
      is the velocity of the block as it slides along the horizontal
      surface? b) How far does the block travel up the incline? 
      c) What is the maximum acceleration of the block as it is 
      accelerated by the spring? 
<LI>  A ball of mass 0.2 kg is attached to a (very light) string 
      of length 0.4 m. The ball is rotating around the vertical
      axis such that the string makes a constant angle of 30
      degrees with the vertical. a) What is the tangential 
      velocity of the ball? b) What is the total (kinetic plus
      potential energy) of the ball? What is the ratio of 
      kinetic to potential energy? Assume that the potential 
      energy of the ball is zero when the string is vertical.

<LI> a) energy conservation: 1/2*mv^2=mgR. Get v=sqrt(2gR)=
        7.67 m/sec.<BR>
     b) Energy conservation gives v=sqrt(gR). Normal force 
        is the sum of the centripetal force and the normal
        component of the gravitational force:
        N = m*v^2/R+m*g*cos(alpha)=mg+mg/2=1.5*mg=883 N
        
<LI> a) Energy conservation 1/2*kx^2=1/2*mv^2, so v=sqrt(k/m)x
        =3.11 m/sec. <BR>
     b) Energy conservation 1/2*mv^2=mgh, so h=v^2/(2*g)=0.49m.
        Distance traveled d=h/sin(alpha)=0.76m.<BR>
     c) Force F=kx, acceleration a=F/m=k/m*x=44 m/s^2= 4.5g

<LI> a) centriptal force F_c=mv^2/r, gravitational force F_g=mg;
        equilibrium condition tan(alpha)=F_c/F_g, so v=sqrt(rg*tan(alpha)).
        Use r=l*sin(alpha), get v=sqrt(lg*sin(alpha)*tan(alpha))=
        sqrt(lg*0.29)=1.06 m/sec. <BR>
     b) K=1/2*m*v^2=0.11 J, U=mgh=mgl*(1-cos(alpha))=mgl*0.13=0.105 J.<BR>
        Ratio K/U=tan(alpha)*sin(alpha)/2/(1-cos(alpha))=1.07
