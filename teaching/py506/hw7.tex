 In class we introduced the Fermi gas model of 
nuclei. Consider a Fermi gas of protons and
neutrons. The total energy depends on the 
number of protons, $Z$, and the number of
neutrons, $N$. We will assume that $N$ and
$Z$ are not very different. Write the total 
energy in the form 
\[
 E = a_V A + a_A\frac{(Z-A/2)^2}{A}+\ldots,
\]
where $\ldots$ are terms of higher order 
in $(Z-A/2)$. Express the volume energy 
$a_V$ and the asymmetry energy $a_A$ in 
units of the (average) Fermi energy 
\[
\epsilon_F=\frac{\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m_N},
\]
where $k_F$ is the average Fermi momentum
of the protons and neutrons.
