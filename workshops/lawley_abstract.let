From quarks to nucleons to neutron stars: exploring QCD with
astrophysics

Sarah Lawley (JLab) 

We use an effective quark model to describe nucleons, nuclear matter and
quark matter.  By calculating the equations of state and the
corresponding compact star properties, we show that the internal
properties of the nucleon may have important implications for the
properties of the system.
