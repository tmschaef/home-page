TITLE
Properties of heavy-light mesons from the field-correlator method

ABSTRACT
The Field-Correlator Method is used to derive the Green's functions of
mesons. Meson properties expressed in terms of this Green's function,
appear to be expressed through universal constants: the string tension
$\sigma$, the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, and the quarl pole masses.
Predictions for the D, D_S, B, B_s, and B_c will be given and compared
to the existing experimental data.
