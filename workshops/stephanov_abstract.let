Abstract:

I shall describe a bottom-up approach to constructing a
higher-dimensional theory holographically dual to QCD.
Hadronic models built in this way simultaneously satisfy
chiral symmetry constraints together with QCD sum rules
and can be constrained by matching asymptotic behavior of QCD
correlation functions. The simplest model of this type gives a
remarkably good fit to low energy hadronic observables.
