Big Bang Nucleosytnesis and recent topics in particle and nuclear
cosmology

Abstract:

In this talk, I would like to discuss some current problems in Big
Bang Nucleosytnesis (BBN) from the viewpoint of the particle and
nuclear physics.

In particular, the discrepancy of the Li7 abundance between the
theoretical prediction and the observational data has been reported. I
would like to discuss this problem in the context of new physics
beyond the standard model.
