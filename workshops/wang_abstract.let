We investigate the strange nucleon form factors in the perturbative
chiral quark model. The momentum dependence of the form factors,
radii and magnetic moments are calculated in the one loop level.
The results are consistent with the SAMPLE and HAPPEX experiments.
The non-local effective quark-meson interaction Lagrangian is applied
to investigate the electromagnetic pi and sigma meson form factors.
A variety of strong and weak decay characteristics involving B (D)
and sigma mesons are studied.
