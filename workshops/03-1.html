In June 2000, Brookhaven National Laboratory's
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) reported the first 
collisions between gold nuclei at center of mass energies
of <img src="sqrt.gif"> = 65 GeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. In 
2001 the first collisions at the maximum  RHIC energy of
<img src="sqrt.gif"> = 200 GeV were recorded. This is a factor 
of more than X 10 increase over the
previously available collisions in fixed-target experiments,
<img src="sqrt.gif"> = 19.4 GeV at the CERN-SPS and
<img src="sqrt.gif"> = 5.4 GeV at the BNL-AGS.
The first data from RHIC reveal several exciting and qualitatively novel
features and represent a major advance of heavy ion physics in 
the ultrarelativistic energy regime.
The main purpose of this INT program is to discuss these results
in order to assess the progress in understanding heavy-ion collision 
dynamics and its implications for the physics of hot and dense nuclear 
matter.
 <p>
At zero temperature and small baryon number density, quarks and
gluons are confined inside hadrons, and chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken. Lattice simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
indicate that, at temperatures of the order of 150 MeV (at zero baryon
number density), quarks and gluons become deconfined, and chiral symmetry
is restored.  This novel thermodynamic phase of nuclear matter is commonly
termed "quark-gluon plasma" (QGP). In nature, temperatures of the order
of 150 MeV existed only shortly after the Big Bang. However, for more
than two decades, attempts have been made to recreate similar conditions
within the collision of heavy nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies.
The comparison is not perfect, since a nuclear collision creates an
environment that, while highly excited, is (at least initially)
far from thermodynamic equilibrium, while lattice QCD
describes exclusively matter in thermodynamic equilibrium.
Hence, far beyond equilibrium thermodynamics, the phenomenology
of relativistic heavy ion collisions has become an interdisciplinary
field which involves concepts of elementary particle physics, nuclear
physics, and the thermo- and hydrodynamics of hot and dense
mesoscopic systems.
<p>

After fixed-target experimental programs at BNL's AGS
and CERN's SPS, RHIC has become the
new high-energy frontier in the study of hot and dense matter.
Since heavy-ion physics is mainly driven by phenomenology, this INT
program will encourage a close interaction between theorists and
heavy-ion experimentalists. Detailed presentations of the
data accumulated in the first 3 years of RHIC will be followed
by intensive discussions of their theoretical interpretation.
The program will focus on the following main topics:
<p>
<ul><li>
Hadronic observables: single inclusive hadronic particle spectra and
moments thereof (radial flow, directed flow, elliptic flow);
rapidity distribution of multiplicity, total multiplicity, particle
ratios, 2-particle correlations, multiplicity fluctuations.

<li> Electromagnetic observables: low-, intermediate-, and high-mass
dileptons; direct photons.

<li>Hard probes: jet production and quenching seen through
high-energy hadron fragments; modified fragmentation functions;
back-to-back correlations; heavy-flavor quark production.
</ul>
<p>
Each observable is characteristic of a certain stage
in a heavy-ion collision.
The above ordering reflects roughly an anti-time ordering:
hadrons emerge only in the final stage of the collision
(due to their short mean free path),
while electromagnetic observables emerge predominantly from the
earlier, hot stage of the collision, and "hard" particles probe
the very early, initial stage of the collision.
The discussion will focus on a critical
assessment of the proposed signatures for the creation of
the QGP at RHIC.  Beyond that, we also hope to
gain understanding of the physics of parton saturation,
the detailed mechanisms of
initial and secondary particle production, the subsequent approach
towards equilibration, and collective expansion of matter until
freeze-out.
<p>
We aim to discuss these topics in the following order<p>
<li>Pre-equilibrium:  31 Mar - 20 Apr<br>
(small-x, classical glue, shadowing, pa, eA, ...)<p>
<li>Towards equilibrium:  21 Apr - 11 May<br>
(real time glue, parton cascading, transport theory, ...)<p>
<li>Equilibrium: 12 May - 1 June<br>
(particle ratios, thermal models, fluctuations, hydro, flow, HBT, ..)<p>
<li>Hard + penetrating probes: 2 June - 20 June<br>
(dileptons, photons, J/<font face="Symbol">y</font>'s, jets, ...)
