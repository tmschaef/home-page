Deconfinement and Matrix Models

Abstract: The deconfining phase transition is studied within a matrix 
model.  A new type of phase transition, termed a "Gross-Witten point", 
is seen to emerge for an infinite number of colors. I summarize lattice 
data which indicates that for three colors, the deconfining transition 
is near this point.
