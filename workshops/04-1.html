 We envision a program that brings together researchers in
high-density QCD, effective theories, lattice QCD, and
compact-star physics. Until recently researchers in these
three areas had little contact with each other.
However, in the past few years there have been great advances
in understanding dense QCD theoretically, and in simulating
the theory using lattice QCD.  Simultaneously, there is a
wealth of new observations of compact astrophysical
objects which could provide evidence for the nature of dense
matter.
<p>
 High-density QCD is a new frontier in the investigation of
the QCD phase diagram. The theoretical study of the ``condensed 
matter physics'' of QCD has led to several surprising 
discoveries, such as robust color superconducting 
phases and a new color-flavor-locked phase of quark 
matter. There are many important problems that remain to be
studied. We would like to understand how to combine 
perturbative QCD and effective field theory techniques
in order to perform systematic studies of the phase 
diagram and the structure of matter at high baryon 
density. We would like to systematically build in 
correlations that correspond to the formation of 
nucleons at moderate density. At even lower density 
we would like to see whether one can gain additional 
insights into the traditional nuclear matter problem 
using methods such the renormalization group.
<p>
 Ultimately, many interesting questions will have to be
settled with the help of numerical simulations on the
lattice. Currently this is not feasible because standard
simulation methods suffer from the fermion sign problem.
Recently, important progress was made in simulating QCD
for non-zero temperature and small chemical potential.
These simulations are based on improved reweighting methods
or analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential.
We plan to bring together experts in lattice QCD and
analytical methods in order to assess the status, the range
of applicability, and limitations of the current simulation
methods. We wish to discuss how these methods can be
extended to larger chemical potential and smaller
temperature. Methods such as the reweighting technique
present an important practical step forward, but
fall short of being a true solution of the sign
problem. We also wish to discuss ideas that may
eventually lead to solutions of the sign problem.
<p>
 Compact stars are the only physical objects
in which cold and dense baryonic matter is realized in
nature. Neutron star observations have always provided
important constraints on the nuclear equation of state.
Today, a new generation of X-ray satellites such as
Chandra and XMM-Newton, as well as the Rossi XTE,
is providing an unprecedented wealth of data on the 
spectra of neutron stars. As a result, we expect 
significant further information on neutron star 
masses, radii, long term cooling and possible exotic internal
states, surface composition, and physics in strong gravity,
to emerge. Other important observables are the spin evolution 
of neutron stars, including short term time variability (glitches) 
which provide information on internal states of superfluidity,
and possible observations of the neutrino burst from a nearby 
supernova. 
<p>
  One of our objectives is to bring together experts on
the structure and evolution of neutron stars as well as
theorists who study the high density phase of QCD. We also
plan to invite observers in order to discuss recent
findings. We wish to critically examine the question
how neutron stars can serve as useful laboratories to address the
high density phase of QCD and to identify the observables
that hold the most promise in this regard.
