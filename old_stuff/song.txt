Hello Boys and Girls. This is your old pal Stinky Wizzleteats. This
is a song about a whale. No! Its a song about being HAPPY! That's right.
Its the Happy Happy Joy Joy song!

Happy Happy Joy Joy, Happy Happy Joy Joy
Happy Happy Joy Joy, Happy Happy Joy Joy
Happy Happy Joy Joy, Happy Happy Joy Joy
Happy Happy Joy Joy Joy!

I don't think your happy enough. That's right. I'll teach you to be happy.
I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs! Now boys and girls, lets try it
again!

Happy Happy Joy Joy, Happy Happy Joy Joy
Happy Happy Joy Joy, Happy Happy Joy Joy
Happy Happy Joy Joy, Happy Happy Joy Joy

Ifn' you ain't the granddaddy of all liars! The little creatures of
nature. They don't know that they are ugly! That's very funny, a fly
marrying a bumblebee. I told ya I'd shoot! But you didn't believe me!
Why didn't you believe me?
