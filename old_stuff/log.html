What rolls down stairs and over in pairs
And over you're neighbours dog...
What fits on your back and it's great for a snack
It's log log log
It's LO-OG It's LO-OG
It's big it's heavy it's wood.
It's LO-OG It's LO-OG
It's better than bad it's good!
Everyone wants a log
You're gonna love a log
Come in and get your log
It's Log Log Log!
