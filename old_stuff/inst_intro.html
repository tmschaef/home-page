<H2><B><FONT SIZE=+4>What is an instanton? </FONT></B></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The technical answer</FONT>:</P>

<P><BR>
Instantons are <B>classical</B> finite action solutions of the <B>euclidean</B>
equations of motion. They are chracterized by a non-vanishing <B>topological
charge</B>. </P>

<LI><B>Why classical? </B></LI>

<DT>Classical solutions are of interest because they can serve as a </DT>

<DT>startting point for the semi-classical expansion in field theory.</DT>

<DT>This is most easily seen from the Feynman path integral: In the</DT>

<DT>limit h-&gt;0, the dominant path corresponds to a solution of the </DT>

<DT>classical equations of motion. Quantum corrections correspond</DT>

<DT>to fluctuations around the classical path. </DT>

<DT>In ordinary perturbation theory, we expand vacuum amplitudes </DT>

<DT>around the trivial classical vacuum. But many important non-</DT>

<DT>perturbative phenomena (e.g. tunneling) can not be studied this</DT>

<DT>way (they do not appear at any finite order in this expansion). </DT>

<DT>Instead, we have to find more appropriate, non-trivial, vacuum </DT>

<DT>configurations to expand around.</DT>

<LI><B>Why euclidean?</B></LI>

<DT>There is a naive, a physical, and a practical answer to that question.
</DT>

<DT>The naive one: Many interesting field theories have no stable, localized
</DT>

<DT>(soliton) solutions in Minkowski space.</DT>

<DT>The more physical one: Classical solutions in euclidean space have
</DT>

<DT>special significance because they correspond to tunneling events in</DT>

<DT>Minkowski space. This is an example for the kind of situation mentioned</DT>

<DT>above, a physical effect that cannot be discussed in terms of ordinary</DT>

<DT>perturbation theory. </DT>

<DT>And the practical one: Non-perturbative approaches to quantum field</DT>

<DT>theory (e.g. the lattice) are best formulated in euclidean space </DT>

<DT>(where everything is positive and looks like statistical mechanics).</DT>

<DT>To understand what happens in lattice field theory, we need configurations</DT>

<DT>that give important contributions to the euclidean partition function.</DT>

<LI><B>Why topology?</B></LI>

<DT>The stability of the instanton solution is related to the existence</DT>

<DT>of a conserved charge. But this charge is not associated with a continous
symmetry of the theory (the instanton has vacuum quantum numbers), but
</DT>

<DT>with the topological properties of the instanton. The instanton has
a non-zero ``winding number&quot;, and no continous transformation of the
</DT>

<DT>fields can unwind the instanton solution.</DT>

<DT>The topological properties of the instanton have many important </DT>

<DT>consequences. For example, fields with non-trivial topology are </DT>

<DT>intimately connected with anomalies, classical symmetries of the </DT>

<DT>theory that are violated on the quantum level.</DT>
