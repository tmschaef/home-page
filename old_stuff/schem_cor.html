There is <a href="negele_fig8.html"> evidence </a> that hadronic
correlation are dominated by classical instanton configurations.
How can that be, how can instantons bind pions, protons and other
light hadrons? <br>
Here's how: The quark propagator in the field of an instanton 
is dominated by <a href="zero_mode.html"> zero modes </a>. 
These modes have very definite chirality properties: instantons
absorb left handed zero quarks and emit right handed ones while
antiistantons absorb right handed quarks and turn them into 
left handed quarks. This fact is <a href="http://www.buchanan96.org">
crucial </a> (sorry, bad joke) in order to understand the
