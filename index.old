<h1>Welcome to schaefer's home page !!</h1>
<h2>
If this page looks barren, it's because I'm too busy to put anything on it,
I know I should have looked up <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/Software/Data_Formats/HTML/Guides_and_Tutorials/">references  on how to compose
my home page</a>...
<p>
Thanks for dropping by ! Have a nice day !
